    <li>After creating my instructor-led version I was inspired to try a twist on a treasure map approach for an eLearning module.</li>
    <li>Problem: Any time people have to work together in a team, conflict is bound to arise. Some team members need outside help to settle the conflict and go to their leadership.</li>

  <summary> Getting Started with Google Suite </summary>
  <ul style ="list-style'type:disc">
    <li>Redeveloped after school claimed originals that I had used with my teammates.</li>
    <li>Problem: Schools are moving to one-to-one where every student has a computer. Teachers are being told to move their classrooms digitally. A majority of the teachers are unfamiliar with the technology available to them.</li>
    <li>Solution: Bite-size learning presentations that introduce one of the main digital toolset available.</li>
    <li>Technology Used: Microsoft Word, Snag-it (Screen Capture and Screen Recorder), DaVinci Resolve (Audio and Video Editing Software), Articulate 360</li>

  <summary> Articulate Storyline: Classification Unit </summary>
  <ul style ="list-style'type:disc">
    <li>Originally this was designed for an Instructor-Led class. It is based on the conceptual change model. The conceptual change model helps teachers teach for conceptual change. Student’s misconceptions of a subject are documented at the very beginning of a lesson; during phase one (commit to a position). Students then share their position, during expose beliefs (phase two); this is a type of assessment that will allow the teacher to know where their students stand and how the lesson needs to be tailored through guiding questions to create dissatisfaction with the student’s current views. This dissatisfaction is accomplished during phase three (confront beliefs). This phase generally utilizes an experiment or activity that will allow students to test their beliefs and realize that they are wrong and wonder why, or that they are right and provide support. Once the dissatisfaction is created the model moves into phase four (accommodate the concept). This is where the concept can be introduced through lecture or discussion of what the students observed. Once the students have the basics of the concept then they work on extending the concept, phase five, by going back to the original experiment or activity and working through it with the new understanding. The final phase, go beyond, allows students to apply their knowledge to a completely new problem that is based on the same concept, or a similar one which will transition the students into a new cycle.</li>
    <li>Then the lesson was changed to an eLearning opportunity.</li>
