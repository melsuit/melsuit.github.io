  <summary> Google Form Analytics Data Sheet Set-up Tutorial</summary>
  <ul style ="list-style'type:disc">
    <li>Background: In an effort to digitalize curriculum I moved my unit tests to Google Forms. It was lovely to have a self-grading test and the students loved getting their results by the end of class.</li>
    <li>Problems: </li>
    <ol>
    <li>Being able to gather and look at the data for standards (state requirements for content proficiency) covered by the test.</li>
    <li>Determining how subsets of students were doing on assessments.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Solution: Create a Google Sheet that ran all of the analysis for me.</li>
    <li>Results: Self Grading Test and the ability to run all the analysis I needed for data collection.</li>
    <li>Background cont.: Once I worked out the bugs, I shared it with my fellow teachers who were also looking to move digital with their unit tests.</li>
    <li>Problem: Sharing the spreadsheet and forms created a need for a tutorial on how to set-up and work the spreadsheet and forms.</li>
    <li>Solution: Step by Step Directions along with How to Videos.</li>
    <li>Results: 4 out of the 7 science teachers transitioned to using Google Forms for their unit tests and used the Google Sheet for the analysis.</li>
    <li>This is only a subset of the Step by Step Directions and How to Videos.</li>
    <li>Technology Used: Microsoft Word, Snag-it (Screen Capture and Screen Recorder), DaVinci Resolve (Audio and Video Editing Software).</li>
