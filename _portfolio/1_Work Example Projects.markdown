    <li>Instructor-Led Training</li>
    <li>Problem: Any time people have to work together in a team, conflict is bound to arise. Some team members need outside help to settle the conflict and go to their leadership. </li>
    <li>Solution: Quick micro presentation on recognizing conflict and strategies to help deal with it. </li>
    <li>Technology Used: Microsoft Word and PowerPoint </li>

    <ol>
    <li>A handout with the strategies is needed before moving into the second set of scenarios </li>
    <li> After addressing the second set of scenarios need to address the issue that the strategies are not meant to work in isolation. </li>

    <li>eLearning</li>
    <li>Originally this was designed for an Instructor-Led class. It is based on the conceptual change model. I migrated the lesson over to an eLearning opportunity for a few students who were suspended for the entire unit, so they could work on it at home and stay caught up with the class.</li>

  <ul style ="list-style'type:disc">
  <li>Instructor Led Training</li>
  <li>Problem: One aspect of the Department of Marine Resources (DMR) Onboarding was learning how to deliver the facility tour. Training for this was conducted through shadowing a trained presenter for several tours before taking over and being observed.</li>
  <li> Solution: To make it more efficient for next season I created this presentation that was delivered and then given to staff before the shadowing phase.</li>

  <summary>Science Inquiry Workshop</summary>
  <ul style ="list-style'type:disc">
  <li>Instructor-Led Training</li>
  <li> Problem: New science standards are pushing for science teachers to use Inquiry in their classrooms. Most of the current science teachers did not experience Inquiry learning through their personal schooling or education program so they are not familiar with the concept or how to incorporate it into their course. </li>
  <li> Solution: Two-week workshop for teachers based out of an informal education facility (museum, aquarium, zoo, science center, etc). </li>
