<br/>
I am at a transition point in my career where I am looking to work solely with adult learners and focus more on Instructional Design and Training. I have five years of experience with various aspects of instructional design and training experience along with eleven years and six months of customer service experience. My master’s program has helped to polish my initial design skills by presenting frameworks, instructional models, and new technologies that provide support for what I was instinctively designing.

From the various projects that I have worked on, I have learned to evaluate the needs of my clients and how to develop learner-focused engaging lessons, teaching aids, and other training materials. I design with all possible participants in mind which in turn has led me to embrace and incorporate aspects of Universal Design for Learning into all of my projects. I utilize backward design for my projects and build interactivity into the presentations to help with learner engagement. Learner motivation is tackled through clear learning objectives that link to participants’ daily career so they can see the worth of the training.

I am a strong supporter of the lifelong learner mindset, and I am always eager to learn new skills and knowledge so I can continue to grow. I look forward to a new challenge every day. I have worked to stay current on the best instructional practices, technology, software, and learning pedagogies.
